# Pac3man: Python3 port of Berkeley Pacman

Porting the Berkeley Pacman assignments over to Python 3.

Just the assignment code, but none of the solutions.

My solution code is on a different branch, but that branch is committed to a private Github repo so that students cannot see it. That is not really pertinent information but I wanted to share it because I was really excited to figure it out.

This repo also contains two other assignments, a Markov Babbler and a Naive Bayesian Spam Classifier.




The main function is in "\pac3man\search\pacman.py"

The functions we edit are in "C:\Users\jorda\OneDrive\Desktop\pacman\pac3man\search\search.py"

The other useful folders are util and SearchAgents

Always run from the search directory. 

Thats it
